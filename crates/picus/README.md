# Picus Extraction Guide

This crate translates machine AIR chips into Picus modules.

## Methodology

The translator follows this pipeline:

1. Select one chip from `MipsAir::<Felt>::chips()` using `--chip`.
2. Evaluate that chip with `PicusBuilder`, which records constraints and lookup interactions.
3. Recursively materialize deferred sub-chip calls into auxiliary modules.
4. Build selector-specialized modules by partial-evaluating the base module with one selector enabled.
5. Emit a `top` module with selector postconditions (bit constraints and one-hot upper bound).
6. Serialize a `*.picus` program to disk.

Relevant entry points:

- CLI + orchestration: `crates/picus/src/main.rs`
- AIR-to-Picus builder logic: `crates/picus/src/picus_builder.rs`
- Picus AST / serialization: `crates/picus/src/pcl/`
- Instruction opcode routing spec: `crates/picus/src/opcode_spec.rs`

## OpcodeSpec

`OpcodeSpec` defines how instruction lookups are routed during extraction.

When `PicusBuilder` sees an instruction `send` interaction, it reads the opcode value
from the message payload and calls `spec_for(opcode)`. The resulting spec tells the
extractor:

- `chip`: which opcode-specific chip module should be called.
- `selector`: which selector should be enabled when partially evaluating that chip.
- `arg_to_colname`: how lookup payload slots map onto the target chip columns.

Current use site:

- `MessageBuilder::send` for `LookupKind::Instruction` in `crates/picus/src/picus_builder.rs`.

Why this matters:

- If an opcode is missing in `spec_for`, extraction will panic on that opcode.
- If the `chip` or `selector` is wrong, the generated Picus calls target the wrong module/path.
- If index-to-column mappings are wrong, arguments are wired to incorrect columns.

Rule of thumb:

- Update `opcode_spec.rs` whenever you introduce a new opcode interaction pattern or rename a
  target chip selector/column used by an existing mapping.

## Usage

Run from repository root.

Build:

```bash
cargo build -p zkm-picus
```

Generate a Picus file for one chip:

```bash
cargo run -p zkm-picus -- --chip Branch
```

Useful options:

- `--chip <NAME>`: chip to extract (required).
- `--picus-out-dir <DIR>`: output directory (default: `picus_out`).
- `--assume-selectors-deterministic`: add deterministic assumptions for selector outputs in the top module.
- `PICUS_OUT_DIR=<DIR>`: environment override for output directory.

Example with explicit output directory:

```bash
cargo run -p zkm-picus -- --chip AddSub --picus-out-dir crates/picus/picus_out
```

Output file shape:

- `<OUT_DIR>/<ChipName>.picus`
- Example: `crates/picus/picus_out/Branch.picus`

## Running Picus in AH

After extraction, you can run Picus on the generated file in AH.

Typical flow:

1. Generate the `.picus` file locally (for example `Branch.picus`).
2. Open AH and upload the generated `.picus` file.
3. Run Picus in AH against that uploaded file.
4. Inspect the verification/checking results in AH.

Practical tip:

- If you are iterating quickly, keep a stable output directory (for example
  `crates/picus/picus_out`) so each new extraction is easy to upload and compare.

## Adding Support for a New Chip

This example assumes you added a new machine chip named `MyChip` in `zkm-core-machine`.

1. Expose the chip in the machine chip list.
- Ensure `MipsAir::<Felt>::chips()` includes `MyChip`.
- Ensure the chip has a stable `name()`; this is what `--chip` matches.

2. Ensure the chip has Picus metadata.
- Derive/provide `PicusInfo` metadata for column naming and selectors.
- Mark selector columns (for case-splitting).

Example (from `AddSubCols`):

```rust
use zkm_derive::{AlignedBorrow, PicusAnnotations};

#[derive(AlignedBorrow, PicusAnnotations, Default, Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(C)]
pub struct AddSubCols<T> {
    pub pc: T,
    pub next_pc: T,
    pub add_operation: AddOperation<T>,
    pub operand_1: Word<T>,
    pub operand_2: Word<T>,

    #[picus(selector)]
    pub is_add: T,
    #[picus(selector)]
    pub is_sub: T,
}
```

This annotation pattern is what allows extraction to discover selector columns and produce
selector-specialized Picus modules.

Also implement `picus_info` on the chip. For example, here is what needs to be added for the `AddSub` chip. 

```rust
fn picus_info(&self) -> PicusInfo {
    AddSubCols::<u8>::picus_info()
}
```

Without this, the extractor cannot retrieve selector/column metadata for that chip.

3. Ensure the AIR is compatible with extraction.
- The translator replays `chip.air.eval(builder)` using `PicusBuilder`.
- Interactions that go through builder methods (e.g. instruction/ALU/memory sends, assertions) must be expressible in Picus.

4. Add opcode mapping only if needed.
- If your chip emits instruction-style interactions via `send_instruction`/`receive_instruction`, update:
  - `crates/picus/src/opcode_spec.rs`
  - Add/adjust `spec_for(Opcode::...)` entries so opcode -> chip/selector/argument mapping is correct.

5. Run extraction and inspect output.

```bash
cargo run -p zkm-picus -- --chip MyChip --picus-out-dir crates/picus/picus_out
```

6. Validate generated modules.
- Check the generated file for:
  - expected module names (`MyChip` and any aux modules),
  - selector-specialized modules,
  - top-level selector constraints.

## Troubleshooting

- `Chip name must be provided!`
  - Pass `--chip <NAME>`.
- `No chip found named ...`
  - Verify the exact `name()` string exposed by the chip.
- `PicusBuilder needs at least one selector to be enabled!`
  - Ensure the chip exports selector metadata in `PicusInfo`.
